# Data Scraping with BeautifulSoup and PowerBI Visualization

This project aims to gather data from the web using Python and BeautifulSoup, export it to an Excel dataset, and visualize it with PowerBI.

As an avid fan of grunge music, I decided to center this project around the band Pearl Jam. For data sourcing, I selected the setlist.fm website, a comprehensive database of concert setlists.

## Data Collection
To collect data from setlist.fm, I utilized Python's HTML parser library, BeautifulSoup. The required information includes the dates and locations of concerts, the tours they were part of, the songs performed at each concert, and whether the songs were part of the main set or the encore.

## Data Visualization
For data visualization, I used PowerBI Desktop. To construct a proper data model, I created Excel files for all Pearl Jam albums and songs, and I also categorized unique venues and tours into separate datasets.
